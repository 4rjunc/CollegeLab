      <b>Water</b> is an <i>inorganic compound</i> with the chemical formula H<sub>2</sub>O. It is a
      <u>transparent, tasteless, odorless</u>,and nearly colorless chemical
      substance, and it is the main constituent of Earth's <del>stratosphere</del> <ins>hydrosphere</ins> and the
      fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent).
      It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food
      energy, or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H<sub>2</sub>O, indicates
      that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms,
      connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen
      atom at an angle of 104.45<sup>Â°</sup>.<mark>"Water"</mark> is also the name of the liquid
      state of H<sub>2</sub>O at standard temperature and pressure.
