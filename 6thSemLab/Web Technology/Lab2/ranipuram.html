<h2>Ranipuram Trek: Ooty of Kerala </h2>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p align="justify"> In the Kasargod district of Kerala is Ranipuram, popularly known
as the ‘Ooty of Kerala’ and previously called Madathumala. It is an offbeat trekking destination, which is sparsely populated and provides panoramic views as you walk across misty, lush green grasslands. Due to the length of the trail, Ranipuram makes for a perfect one-day getaway if you reside in or around Mangalore or in the northern part of Kerala.
