        <h2>Ananthapura Lake Temple </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p align="justify"> In the northern tip of Kerala lies the Ananthapura Lake Temple,
            the only lake temple in Kerala. The rectangular lake, supplied with regular spring water, hosts this
            magnificent temple. It is considered the moolasthanam (original abode) of Lord Ananthapadmanabha, the deity
            of the famous Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram. This 9th-century temple is situated 30 km
            from Bekal in Kasaragod district. The view of the hillocks from the temple is extremely famous. Babia, the
            vegetarian crocodile and temple guardian, is popular among visitors. The drive to the temple in itself is
            extremely peaceful and calming.
